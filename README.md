**FocusHut: a tool to encourage positive studying techniques**

Students can choose between two study methods: The Pomodoro Technique or The Feynman Technique. Both of the study methods will use a timer which allocates a certain amount of time to studying a particular topic. If students choose the Feynman Technique, they will be encouraged to write what they have learned into a simple and concise paragraph. Along with these two study methods, FocusHut will also contain soothing graphics to provide a calm study environment. FocusHut will also provide relaxing background stress to reduce the stress students may feel as they study.
